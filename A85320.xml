            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Friday, <hi>December</hi> 23. came into <hi>Cambridge,</hi> two Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Women, the one of them about 50. the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30. years old, who went to <hi>Sidney-Seſſex-Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and fell into diſcourſe with ſome Schollars there, about God and Chriſt; the Schollars asked them <hi>how many Gods there were?</hi> The women anſwered, <hi>but one God;</hi> and told them, <hi>they had many that they made Gods</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:152268:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>of:</hi> at which the Schollars laughed and ſcoffed them; the women told the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars they were <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> and that <hi>their Colledg was a Cage of unclean Birds, and the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> Hereupon complaint was made to Mr. <hi>William Pickering</hi> Mayor of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> that two women were preaching; who immediately ſent for them by a Conſtable; and when they were before him, he demanded of them, <hi>whence they came, and where they lay the laſt night?</hi> They anſwered him, <hi>they were strangers, and knew not the name of the place; but paid for what they called for, and came away.</hi> The Mayor asked them <hi>what was their names?</hi> they anſwered, <hi>their names were written in the book of life.</hi> Again he asked them, <hi>What was their husbands names?</hi> they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>they had no husband but Jeſus Christ, and he ſent them.</hi> Upon this the Mayor was in a great rage, and thruſt them to the dore of his houſe, and ſaid they were whores, and made a Warrant to the Conſtable to <hi>whip them at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Croſſe untill the blood came.</hi> And when the poore women heard that, they fell
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152268:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> down on their knees, and deſired the Lord <hi>to forgive him, for he knew not what he did.</hi> And the Mayor ſpake to the Conſtable, and bad him ſee them whipt till the blood ran down their bodies, and ſent three of his Sergeants to ſee it done to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and 'twas done accordingly; but by what Law no man knows; for they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did beg or ſteal.</p>
            <p>So they were led away to the Market-Croſs, crying, <hi>The Lord strengthen our faith, the Lord strengthen our faith,</hi> &amp;c. And when the Executioner came, he commanded them to put off their cloaths; they ſaid, <hi>they would not, they were there; if he had any thing to do to them, they bad him do it,</hi> for they would not: ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately he ſtripped firſt one all naked to the waſte, and then the other, and put their arms into the Whipping Poſt, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Mayors Warrant on them, in as fierce and cruel a manner as could be, that ſo their bodies were cut, and ſlaſhed, and torn, as never were the bodies of any rogues, or thieves, or whores, ſeen to be, as thoſe poor Chriſtians were; who took
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152268:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> their puniſhment ſo chearfully, that they never whinched for it, nor was their pain ſeen by any change of their countenance, as if there had not been any thing done to them; and all the while they were in their puniſhment, they ſang and rejoyced, ſaying, <hi>the Lord be bleſſed, the Lord be praiſed, who hath thus strengthened and honoured us to ſuffer for his name ſake.</hi> And when all was done, they ſaid to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, <hi>If you think you have not done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, we are here ready to ſuffer more for our Saviour Christ:</hi> and then they fell down on their knees, and <hi>prayed God to forgive them, for they knew not what they had done.</hi> So being led back into the Town towards the Caſtle end, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted all people to <hi>fear God, and not to care for men,</hi> telling the people, <hi>this was but the beginning of the ſufferings of Gods people.</hi> So they were thruſt out of the Town, no man ſo much as giving them <hi>a cup of cold water,</hi> that the Scripture might be fulfilled in the 129 <hi>Pſalm, The plowers plowed upon my back, and made long fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi>
